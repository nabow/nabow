            <h1><center>Welcome to Stalag 13!</center></h1>
            <p>Running from 1965 to 1971, this sitcom is the longest running TV show about World War II, lasting longer than the war itself. In the show, allied prisoners of war operate an organization that specializes in helping other prisoners of war out of Germany, gathering intelligence for the Allies, and sabotaging the German war effort. While the show has a lighthearted tone overall, it does not shy away from reminding the audience of the stakes: if any one of the prisoners were caught, they would no longer be protected by the Geneva Convention and could be shot as spies. The balance between comedy and serious moments is done exceptionally well, making the viewers grow attached to the characters and worry for them during those tense moments.</p>
            <p>Though this show depicts Nazi characters in a comedic manner, the people involved with the show were careful to create it in a tactful way. All the recurring German characters and a large number of the recurring guest stars were Jewish, and several of the leading European characters were played by survivors of the Holocaust. Not wanting to offend any veterans of the war, a showing of the pilot episode was done for some of those who had been prisoners of war in Germany, and it was received with wide approval.</p>

        <div id="Hogan">
            <center><img src="hogan.png" height="300px" alt="Colonel Hogan"></center>
            <h2><center>Colonel Robert E. Hogan</center></h2>
            <p> As senior officer of the prisoners at Stalag 13, Colonel Hogan is in charge of their secret organization, with orders to "assist escaping prisoners, cooperate with all friendly forces, and use every means to harass and injure the enemy." By bringing in prisoners who have escaped from other POW camps, Hogan is able to make it appear as if no one ever leaves Stalag 13; when one man goes, another takes his place. With his quick wit and a tendency towards the overelaborate, Hogan is not above using deception to get what he wants, but he puts his duties first and genuinely cares about all the men in his command.</p>

        <div id="Klink">
            <center><img src="klink.jpg" height="300px" alt="Colonel Klink"></center>
            <h2><center>Colonel Wilhelm Klink</center></h2>
            <p>Colonel Klink, the ambitious yet spineless commandant of the POW camp, has a perfect record: no prisoner has ever escaped from Stalag 13.  Unbeknowst to him, this record is only intact because Hogan and the other prisoners assist in maintaining it, since it is because of Klink's incompetence that they are able to operate their organization in Stalag 13. Without this record, Klink would face his greatest fear: being sent into active duty at the Russian front. Klink desperately wants a promotion to general, and Hogan uses both of these things to manipulate Klink into doing what is most helpful to the organziation.</p>

        <div id="Schultz">
            <center><img src="schultz.jpg" height="300px" alt="Sergeant Schultz"></center>
            <h2><center>Sergeant Hans Schultz</center></h2>
            <p>Sergeant Schultz is a guard that just wants to get through the war alive. He is friendly with the prisoners, who often bribe him with food to give out information, and they make little to no effort to hide their plans or activities from him. While Schultz does occasionally feel that he should report them, the fear of being punished for letting such activities happen on his watch prevents him from ever doing so.</p>

        <div id="Kinch">
            <center><img src="kinch.jpg" height="200px" alt="Sergeant Kinchloe"></center>
            <h3>Sergeant James Kinchloe</h3>
            <p>Acting as Hogan's unofficial second in command, Sergeant Kinchloe, affectionately called "Kinch" by his friends, operates the radio in the prisoners' secret tunnel. The most realistic of the bunch, he reminds Hogan of the practical details that are sometimes overlooked when Hogan plans a scheme.</p>

        <div id="Newkirk">
            <center><img src="newkirk.jpg" height="200px" alt="Corporal Newkirk"></center>
            <h3>Corporal Peter Newkirk</h3>
            <p>Corporal Newkirk is the assigned conman whenever the group needs to break into Klink's safe, forge papers, or steal items directly on a person. Oftentimes a pessimist, he has a tendency to be sarcastic and grumpy, but beneath that he cares very deeply about his fellow prisoners and wholeheartedly believes in them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="LeBeau">
            <center><img src="lebeau.png" height="200px" alt="Corporal LeBeau"></center>
            <h3>Corporal Louis LeBeau</h3>
            <p>A short, proud Frenchman, Corporal LeBeau is the resident chef at Stalag 13. He often has to cook for dinner parties Klink throws for visiting German officers, but he and the others use these as opportunities to gather information from the enemy. He has a fiery temper and a big heart, and he is entirely dedicated to anything he does, no matter how small the task.</p>

        <div id="Carter">
            <center><img src="carter.jpg" height="200px" alt="Sergeant Carter"></center>
            <h3>Sergeant Andrew Carter</h3>
            <p>Though he can be clumsy and make careless mistakes, Sergeant Carter is very skilled in explosives and demolitions. He is also particularly good at impersonating high ranking German officers whenever the occasion arises. His friendly nature often makes him unsuspected of any foul play, which the prisoners have used to their advantage on multiple occasions.</p>
